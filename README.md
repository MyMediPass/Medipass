# Project README

This document outlines the current authentication and data storage mechanisms, and potential next steps for improvement.

## Authentication

Authentication is handled using [Supabase Auth](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth).

-   **Provider:** Supabase
-   **Mechanism:**
    -   The Next.js middleware (`middleware.ts`) is configured to intercept Supabase authentication callback routes (specifically, when a `code` parameter is present on the root path `/`).
    -   The Supabase client is initialized in `lib/supabase.ts` for both server components (`createServerSupabaseClient`) and client components (`createClientSupabaseClient`).
    -   It uses environment variables `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` for configuration.
    -   The authentication flow is set to `pkce` (Proof Key for Code Exchange), which is a security best practice for OAuth 2.0.
    -   Sessions are persisted, and tokens are automatically refreshed.

## Data Storage

Data storage is managed by [Supabase's integrated Postgres database](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database).

-   **Provider:** Supabase (Postgres)
-   **Mechanism:**
    -   The same Supabase client initialized in `lib/supabase.ts` is used for database interactions.
    -   Database operations (CRUD) can be performed using the Supabase JavaScript library.
    -   The `migrations/` directory suggests that database schema changes are managed, likely using Supabase CLI or a similar tool.

## Next Steps for Improvement & Feature Implementation

To achieve the goal of user profiles, file uploads, medical records, and AI chat history, the following steps can be taken:

### 1. User Profiles

*   **Database Schema:**
    *   Create a `profiles` table in your Supabase Postgres database.
    *   This table should have a foreign key relationship with `auth.users` (Supabase's built-in users table), likely using the user's `id` as the primary key.
    *   Include columns for profile-specific information (e.g., `full_name`, `date_of_birth`, `avatar_url`, etc.).
*   **API Routes/Server Actions:**
    *   Implement Next.js API routes or Server Actions to handle profile creation, updates, and retrieval.
    *   Ensure these endpoints are protected and can only be accessed by authenticated users for their own profiles (or by authorized personnel, if applicable).
*   **UI Components:**
    *   Develop React components to display and edit user profiles.

### 2. File Uploads (e.g., for medical documents, profile avatars)

*   **Storage Solution:**
    *   Utilize [Supabase Storage](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage). It integrates well with Supabase Auth for managing access permissions.
    *   Create buckets for different types of files (e.g., `avatars`, `medical_records`).
*   **Database Schema:**
    *   Create a `files` or `documents` table to store metadata about uploaded files (e.g., `file_name`, `file_type`, `size`, `storage_path`, `uploaded_by_user_id`, `upload_timestamp`).
    *   This table should have a foreign key to the `profiles` table or `auth.users` table.
*   **API Routes/Server Actions:**
    *   Implement endpoints for handling file uploads (streaming to Supabase Storage) and retrieving file information/download links.
    *   Manage permissions carefully (e.g., users can only upload to their own designated folders or access files they are permitted to see).
*   **UI Components:**
    *   Create components for file input, upload progress, and displaying lists of uploaded files.

### 3. Medical Records

*   **Database Schema:**
    *   This will be more complex and depends on the specific data you want to store. Consider multiple related tables:
        *   `medical_conditions` (e.g., `condition_id`, `profile_id`, `condition_name`, `diagnosed_date`, `notes`).
        *   `medications` (e.g., `medication_id`, `profile_id`, `medication_name`, `dosage`, `frequency`, `start_date`, `end_date`).
        *   `appointments` (e.g., `appointment_id`, `profile_id`, `doctor_name`, `date`, `reason`, `notes`).
        *   `allergies` (e.g., `allergy_id`, `profile_id`, `allergen`, `reaction`, `severity`).
    *   Ensure relationships are correctly defined (e.g., one-to-many from `profiles` to `medical_conditions`).
    *   **Security & Privacy (HIPAA/GDPR considerations):** Storing medical records requires a high level of security and compliance with regulations like HIPAA (in the US) or GDPR (in Europe). Supabase provides tools, but you are responsible for implementing compliance. This might involve:
        *   Row-Level Security (RLS) policies in Postgres to ensure users can only access their own data.
        *   Encryption at rest (Supabase handles this for Postgres) and potentially in transit (ensure HTTPS).
        *   Audit trails for data access and modifications.
        *   Careful consideration of data sharing and consent.
*   **API Routes/Server Actions:**
    *   Develop secure endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting medical records.
    *   Implement strict authorization logic.
*   **UI Components:**
    *   Design intuitive and secure interfaces for users to manage their medical information.

### 4. AI Chat History

*   **Database Schema:**
    *   Create a `chat_sessions` table (e.g., `session_id`, `profile_id`, `created_at`, `session_topic`).
    *   Create a `chat_messages` table (e.g., `message_id`, `session_id`, `sender` (e.g., 'user' or 'ai'), `content`, `timestamp`).
    *   Establish a one-to-many relationship between `chat_sessions` and `chat_messages`.
*   **API Routes/Server Actions:**
    *   Endpoints to:
        *   Create new chat sessions.
        *   Save user messages and AI responses.
        *   Retrieve chat history for a user.
*   **AI Integration:**
    *   Integrate with your chosen AI model/service (the `ai` package is in your `package.json`, which could be Vercel AI SDK or similar).
    *   Pass relevant context (e.g., previous messages in the session) to the AI.
*   **UI Components:**
    *   Develop a chat interface for users to interact with the AI and view their conversation history.

### General Recommendations:

*   **Environment Variables:** Continue to use environment variables for all sensitive keys and configuration. Do not commit them to your repository. Use a `.env.local` file for local development and configure them in your hosting provider (e.g., Vercel) for deployments.
*   **Error Handling & Logging:** Implement robust error handling and consider adding logging (e.g., using a service or Supabase's logging capabilities) for easier debugging and monitoring.
*   **Data Validation:** Use libraries like Zod (already in your `package.json`) for validating data on both the client and server sides to ensure data integrity and security.
*   **Testing:** Write tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) to ensure the reliability of your authentication, data storage, and new features.
*   **Security Best Practices:**
    *   Regularly review and update Supabase RLS policies.
    *   Sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS and other injection attacks.
    *   Keep dependencies updated.
    *   Consider security headers and other web security best practices.
*   **Scalability:** While Supabase can scale, monitor your usage and database performance as your application grows. Optimize queries and consider database indexing.

This roadmap should provide a clear path forward for developing the desired features. Remember to tackle these incrementally and test thoroughly at each stage.
