# Auth Refactor to Clerk - Summary

Number of distinct refactoring operations (files created, edited, or deleted as part of the auth migration to Clerk): 22

**Key areas addressed:**

1.  **Supabase Client Configuration:**
    *   Modified `lib/supabase/server.ts` to inject Clerk JWT.
    *   Added `useSupabaseClient` hook to `lib/supabase/client.ts` for authenticated client-side instances.
    *   Cleaned up `lib/supabase.ts`, retaining only the service role client.

2.  **Server-Side Auth Helpers (`lib/auth.ts`):
    *   `getUser` now uses `currentUser()` from Clerk.
    *   `getSession` now uses `auth()` from Clerk.
    *   `requireAuth` now uses `auth().userId` from Clerk.
    *   `signOut` updated to remove Supabase calls (Clerk sign-out is primarily client-driven).

3.  **Application Code Refactoring:**
    *   Updated server components, pages, API routes, and server actions that previously used Supabase auth to now use Clerk equivalents (e.g., `currentUser()`, `auth()`) or the refactored helpers from `lib/auth.ts`.
    *   Ensured database queries use Clerk's `userId` where applicable.
    *   Specific files refactored include:
        *   `app/(protected)/ss/page.tsx`
        *   `app/(protected)/admin/settings/page.tsx`
        *   `app/actions/api-key-actions.ts`

4.  **Deletion of Obsolete Supabase Auth Flows:**
    *   Removed old Supabase-specific login pages and actions.
    *   Removed old Supabase-specific registration pages and actions.
    *   Removed old Supabase-specific email confirmation flows.

5.  **UI Component Updates:**
    *   Refactored `components/main-nav.tsx` to use Clerk hooks.
    *   Refactored `components/nav-user.tsx` to align with Clerk `UserResource` and use Clerk `signOut`.
    *   Refactored `components/app-sidebar.tsx` to correctly use Clerk hooks and pass props to `NavUser`.
    *   Refactored `app/(protected)/medications/medications-client.tsx` to align with Clerk `UserResource`.

**Note:** This count includes individual file modifications, creations, and deletions that were part of the direct auth system replacement.
